PROJECT REPORT
SMART STUDY PLANNER

1. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a smart study planner for students that helps them to study based on thier subjects, avalaible time and leaning goal. During exam preparation many students struggle to manage time. This planner provides a way to organize daily and weekly study task using python.

2. Objectives
The main goal of this program involve:
    To develop a simple and user friendly software collecting basic information.
    Produce a customize plan according to input subjects and time.
    To assist in maintaining students' consistency and tracking their studying habit.
    To illustrate practical Python for local Programming.

3. Approach
3.1 Problem Identification
Students struggle to manage and distribute their study time throughout the day. 
3.2 Solution Approach
The Smart Study Planner solves this problem by:
  Taking input from users like name, subjects, total hours and difficulty level.
  Distributing study hours based on difficulty level.
3.3 Tools and Technocologies used
Python


4. Implementation
4.1 Program Structure
  Taking user name
  Asking for subjects name
  Storing difficulty level of each subject
  Asking avalaible hours
  Calculating hour distribution
  Generate final study planner
  
4.2 Sample code overview

#A SMART STUDY PLANNER 

Name=input("Enter your name: ")

Subject1=input("\nEnter 1 subject: ")
Subject2=input("Enter 2 subject: ")
Subject3=input("Enter 3 subject: ")
Subject4=input("Enter 4 subject: ")
Subject5=input("Enter 5 subject: ")

hour_available_per_day=float(input("Enter available hours per day: "))

print("\nNow enter the Difficulty Level of each subject" )
print("Type: easy / medium / hard")

D1=input(f"Difficulty level of {Subject1}: ")
D2=input(f"Difficulty level of {Subject2}: ")
D3=input(f"Difficulty level of {Subject3}: ")
D4=input(f"Difficulty level of {Subject4}: ")
D5=input(f"Difficulty level of {Subject5}: ")

weight={"easy":1, "medium":2, "hard":3}

w1=weight[D1]
w2=weight[D2]
w3=weight[D3]
w4=weight[D4]
w5=weight[D5]

total_weight=w1+w2+w3+w4+w5

time1=(w1/total_weight)*hour_available_per_day
time2=(w2/total_weight)*hour_available_per_day
time3=(w3/total_weight)*hour_available_per_day
time4=(w4/total_weight)*hour_available_per_day
time5=(w5/total_weight)*hour_available_per_day

print("\n-------------------------------")
print("YOUR SMART STUDY PLAN")
print("-------------------------------")

print(f"{Subject1}:{round(time1,2)}hours/day ")
print(f"{Subject2}:{round(time2,2)}hours/day ")
print(f"{Subject3}:{round(time3,2)}hours/day ")
print(f"{Subject4}:{round(time4,2)}hours/day ")
print(f"{Subject5}:{round(time5,2)}hours/day ")

print("\n--------------------------------")
print("Daily Progress Tracker")
print("--------------------------------")

completed=input("Enter the subjects you have completed today (coma separated): ")

completed_list=[x.strip() for x in completed.split(",")]

subjects=[Subject1, Subject2, Subject3, Subject4, Subject5]

pending_list=[s for s in subjects if s is not completed_list]

progress=(len(completed_list)/len(subjects))*100

print("\nCompleted List:", completed_list)
print("\nPending List:", pending_list)
print("\nToday's Progress:", round(progress, 2), "%")


5. Result
-------------------------------
YOUR SMART STUDY PLAN
-------------------------------
maths:2.18hours/day 
physics:1.45hours/day 
english:0.73hours/day
python:2.18hours/day
chemistry:1.45hours/day

--------------------------------
Daily Progress Tracker
--------------------------------
Enter the subjects you have completed today (coma separated): python

Completed List: ['python']

Pending List: ['maths', 'physics', 'english', 'python', 'chemistry']

Today's Progress: 20.0 %


6. Analysis
The planner effectively distributes study time in a structured manner. The results show that difficult subjects naturally receive more time, which helps students focus on weaker areas. The program successfully demonstrates how automation can support academic planning.
