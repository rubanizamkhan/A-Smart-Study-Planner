PROJECT STATEMENT

• Project Title : A Smart Study Planner

• Submitted By : Ruba Nizam Khan

• College : VIT Bhopal University

Scope This project, called the Smart Study Planner aims to develop a Python application that will assist students in generating an effective and personalized daily study planner structure. It is quite difficult to manage time for studies especially if you are dealing with multiple subjects of varying complexity level. The goal of this project is to remedy that issue by proportionately splitting available study hours between subjects according to amount of difficulty, as well as generate a balanced study plan.

Input will student's name, subjects list, difficulty levels (easy,medium and hard) and number of hours for study per day. It is equipped with weighted logic that apportions the time based on how hard subjects are. The utility also features a progress manager, where students can track which topics they've learned and displays daily productivity through the progress percentage.

This program demonstrates the implementation of Python elements — input processing, dictionaries, loops (while and for), if-else conditions and basic arithmetic operations. It also shows how the adoption of so called simple programming problem is solvable can populate a model that solves real academic problems by supporting students to arrange their studies, having better time management and developing solid and reliable learning habits thought out structured and personalized study scheduling.
